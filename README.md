# Shape Stacker
Shape-Stacker is a Tetris inspired game, developed through use of OOP in Python, using the Pygame and Pygame-gui modules. This is a relatively old project, created when I was first experimenting with adding UI to my applications. 

Potential future features include:
  - Option to rotate shapes
  - Shape fall speed increase as user points improve
